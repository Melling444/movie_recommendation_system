We are thrown into the high-voltage drama with full access to the hardcore of dedicated organizers. Even as the growing group of pro-Palestinian activists themselves face fierce resistance from the police, the media and their own fellow students.

Finally choosing to reveal the truth and lies in his life and career, Leonard sits for an extended filmed interview with his former student Malcolm (Michael Imperioli), charging ahead with candid stories about his younger self (Jacob Elordi) in the fractious 1960s and beyond.

You Burn Me,,,"An adaptation of ""Sea Foam,"" a chapter in Cesare Pavese's Dialogues with Leucò, Piñeiro's latest is an intimate and expansive meditation on death and desire and a thrilling exploration of the possibilities of adapting text to film. In ""Sea Foam,"" Pavese stages a fictional dialogue between the ancient Greek poet Sappho and the nymph Britomartis (played by frequent Piñeiro collaborators Gabi Saidón and María Villar). Sappho has thrown herself into the ocean from heartbreak. Britomartis has fallen off a cliff into the water while fleeing a man. Reuniting at the shore, they discuss life, death and the bittersweet nature of desire. But Piñeiro, known for his series of metatextual films dealing with the translation and performance of Shakespeare, is not content to simply restage a dialogue and instead infuses the film with footnotes and lacunae: the fragmentary poetry of Sappho, by whom only one complete poem still exists; the circumstances of Pavese's death, heartbroken in a Turin hotel room; and the science of sea foam with its connections to disease and fertility. In this ebb and flow of death and desire, You Burn Me introduces a game of translation and memorization, a game intrinsic to the moving image that may just save Sappho, Pavese, Piñeiro and the audience from oblivion.","María Villar, Maria Inês Gonçalves, Agustina Muñoz, Ana Cristina Barragán, Michelle Yoon",Matías Piñeiro,"Melanie Schapiro , Garbiñe Ortega , Matías Piñeiro",Matías Piñeiro,The Cinema Guild,Trapecio Cine,,Drama,Spanish,,1h 4m,,,"Mar 7, 2025, Limited",,,,,,,,,,
