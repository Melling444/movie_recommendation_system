Art for Everybody,100%,,"You've seen his cozy cottages, idyllic gardens, and welcoming village streets on everything from canvas to commemorative plates. Both celebrated and disparaged for his kitschy signature settings, the ""Painter of Light"" Thomas Kinkade rocketed to popularity in the '90s by marketing himself to American evangelicals and pitting himself against the elite art establishment. Yet beneath the pristine public persona were demons that would drive him to alcoholism, scandal, and death from an overdose in 2012. After his passing, Kinkade's daughters uncovered a trove of unseen, unexpectedly dark paintings, a discovery that launched an investigation into their father's true personality. Through the voices of skeptical critics, adoring fans, and Kinkade's closest friends and family, ART FOR EVERYBODY digs deep into Kinkade's life and work to elucidate the real man behind the persona. Accomplished editor Miranda Yousef's directorial debut is an insightful documentary that peels back the layers of Kinkade's façade, delivering a portrait of a complex man divided by the same forces that continue to pull us apart as a nation.","Morgan Neville, Tim Rummel, Jessamine Burgum, Kara Durrett, Bill Way",Miranda Yousef,"Morgan Neville , Tim Rummel",,Fourth Act Film,"Whitewater Films , Fit Via Vi Film Productions , Tremolo Productions , Cinosure , The Harnisch Foundation , Pinky Promise , XRM Media",,"Documentary , Biography",English,"Mar 28, 2025, Limited",,1h 38m,,,,,,,,,,

Trevino (structure), and Catherine Gund (direction), combine artists' expressions with historical and observational footage to unveil a rare cinematic mediation about identity, race, racism and resistance as they shape our shared breath. Centering breath as a symbol of resilience, Meanwhile captures raw, unfinished moments--dancers in rehearsal, artists midway through their work--focusing on the act of creation. Rooted in the upheavals of 2020, the film uses breath as its through-line to symbolize collective survival. It invites viewers to witness the process of liberation and be present in the ""meanwhile""--a moment of creation, struggle, and hope that transcends fixed identities.","Melony Lewis, Adam Lewis","Catherine Gund , Jacqueline Woodson , Meshell Ndegeocello , Erika Dilday",,,Abramorama,Aubin Pictures,,"Documentary , Drama",English,"Mar 14, 2025, Limited",,1h 28m,,,,,,,,,,

You Burn Me,,,"An adaptation of ""Sea Foam,"" a chapter in Cesare Pavese's Dialogues with Leucò, Piñeiro's latest is an intimate and expansive meditation on death and desire and a thrilling exploration of the possibilities of adapting text to film. In ""Sea Foam,"" Pavese stages a fictional dialogue between the ancient Greek poet Sappho and the nymph Britomartis (played by frequent Piñeiro collaborators Gabi Saidón and María Villar). Sappho has thrown herself into the ocean from heartbreak. Britomartis has fallen off a cliff into the water while fleeing a man. Reuniting at the shore, they discuss life, death and the bittersweet nature of desire. But Piñeiro, known for his series of metatextual films dealing with the translation and performance of Shakespeare, is not content to simply restage a dialogue and instead infuses the film with footnotes and lacunae: the fragmentary poetry of Sappho, by whom only one complete poem still exists; the circumstances of Pavese's death, heartbroken in a Turin hotel room; and the science of sea foam with its connections to disease and fertility. In this ebb and flow of death and desire, You Burn Me introduces a game of translation and memorization, a game intrinsic to the moving image that may just save Sappho, Pavese, Piñeiro and the audience from oblivion.","María Villar, Maria Inês Gonçalves, Agustina Muñoz, Ana Cristina Barragán, Michelle Yoon",Matías Piñeiro,"Melanie Schapiro , Garbiñe Ortega , Matías Piñeiro",Matías Piñeiro,The Cinema Guild,Trapecio Cine,,Drama,Spanish,"Mar 7, 2025, Limited",,1h 4m,,,,,,,,,,
